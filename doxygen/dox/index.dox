\section intro Introduction
This library has grown over time to include various interfaces as i have required them or have experimented with them and added them.

The core functionality are the referenced lockable data structures that i reimplemented for my own experimentation to understand how and why
they were used in the asterisk project.

There is now a partner to this lib to support GUI applications using the wxWidgets library.
