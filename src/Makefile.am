# Here are a set of rules to help you update your library version information:
#
#    Start with version information of `0:0:0' for each libtool library.
#    Update the version information only immediately before a public release of your software.
#    More frequent updates are unnecessary, and only guarantee that the current interface number gets larger faster.
#    If the library source code has changed at all since the last update, then increment revision (`c:r:a' becomes `c:r+1:a').
#    If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last update, increment current, and set revision to 0.
#    If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then increment age.
#    If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release, then set age to 0.
